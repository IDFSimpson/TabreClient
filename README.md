# Tabreï»¿
Tabre is a bookmarking service and android app for storing and sorting articles on the go. It uses React Native with a Rails server backend. I enjoyed working with an up and coming framework to build native mobile apps with web technologies. I also created a chrome plugin to input bookmarks. This project allowed me to organize my thoughts on existing services.
